# Sourdough Bread Recipe:

## Time:

Approximately 2 hours 45 minutes

## Equipment:

- Scale
- Mixing Bowl
- Proofing Bowl (not required)
- Cookie Sheet
- Parchment Paper
- Stirring Stick/Scraper
- Hands


## Ingredients:

- 1 part sourdough starter (equal parts flour and water by weight)
- 2 parts water minus 1/8th. (Really 1-7/8ths part)
- 3 parts flour
- Salt -- 1-2% of the weight of the **flour**
- Splash of olive oil during kneading to smooth the dough (not required)


## Example of Ingredients:

- 200g (grams) sourdough starter (with sprinkle of yeast if starter isn't strong/bubbly)
- 350g water (200g * 2 = 400g - (1/8 * 400g) = 350g)
- 600g flour (bread or all-purpose)
- 6-12g salt (This is 1-2% of the weight of the *flour*. I prefer more salt, so I use the full 2% (12g))
- drizzle of olive oil before kneading (IDK, like 1 Tbsp?)


## Directions:

- [ ] Pour starter into mixing bowl
- [ ] Add sprinkle of yeast if your starter isn't vigorous
- [ ] Mix (warmish) water with starter
- [ ] Add flour
- [ ] Add salt
- [ ] Stir together with scraper/stick until it becomes shaggy
- [ ] Knead with hands until homogenous (it will still be sticky)
- [ ] Let rest covered for 25 minutes

- [ ] Pour drizzle of olive oil over dough
- [ ] Knead again until elastic and shape the dough
- [ ] Place in floured proofing basket or back in bowl if you don't have one yet
- [ ] Cover and let rest for 1 hour

- [ ] Preheat oven to 475 F
- [ ] Place parchment on bottom of cookie sheet (the bread will sit on the bottom). Place this on top of bowl or proofing basket. With one hand on each (cookie sheet and bowl containing dough), do a quick flip to get the dough to fall down onto the sheet.
- [ ] Make decorative slashes now if you want
- [ ] Put some water in the bottom of a mixing bowl that can fit over your bread and still fit on the cookie sheet
- [ ] Swish water around the bowl and empty
- [ ] Place wetted bowl over bread on baking sheet
- [ ] Bake for 25 minutes
- [ ] Uncover and bake until browned (~25 minutes)


## Notes:

You don't have to do 1/8th less of water, I just find that my dough is stickier than I'd like when doing the full 2x starter weight.

The steam oven technique comes from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt. See his video on it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RUDa0FKplk): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RUDa0FKplk>
