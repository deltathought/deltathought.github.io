This is a blog about whatever I'm interested in at the time. The uppercase "Delta" (used in Physics to denote change or a derivative) alongside "Thought" (meaning the natural consequence of experiencing our surroundings and world) combine to show my desire to be flexible in how I view the world. Another purpose of this blog is to give myself a place to explain concepts I'm struggling with so I can learn them better. Understanding something for a greater purpose (like teaching it to others) is a faster way to learn than just trying to absorb it myself.
